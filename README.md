### Step 1: Decide on what should be highlighted on the website
* Ask what the purpose is of each page
### Step 2: Decide what programing language we can use
    • Django - meant for news sites because it is dynamic (easy to update)
        ○ Python code 
        ○ Html templates - structure of a web page
        ○ SQLite data 
    • JavaScript - make website more interactive 
        ○ Can directly manipulate the DOM
        ○ DOM - Document Object Model - tree like hierarchy of the website 
### Step 3: Set up Django
### Step 4: Figure out how to import all data most efficiently
### Step 5: Continue working on the backend
### Step 6: Start designing the frontend

Front-end: create model templates
